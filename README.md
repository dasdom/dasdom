Hi, my name is Dominik Hauser.
I'm an iOS developer and author from Germany.

## My book

My book Build Location-Based Projects for iOS is in beta right now an will be published soon.
I'm very proud of it.
If you are a beginner in iOS development and would like to have fun while learning something about GPS, sensors and maps, you should check out this book.

Look at this nice cover:
